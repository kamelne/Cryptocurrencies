# Cryptocurrencies

## Overview
Using unsupervised learning we preformed analysis on cryptocurrency data. Data was preprocessed (cleaned, encoded, and scaled) to work best with the learning model and reduce any bias. Then Principle Component Analysis (PCA) was used to reduce the dimension of the dataframe and make the analysis simpler. An elbow curve was made to quickly decide on the k-means clusters to use. Finally the data was visualized.
